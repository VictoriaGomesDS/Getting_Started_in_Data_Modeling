# Getting Started in Data Modeling // IN DEVELOPMENT
A little bit about my progress during my resumption in the world of data modeling =)

In this project I worked on new knowledge about the conceptual, logical and physical modeling of a simple database for a small bookstore. From the survey and understanding of the library owners' needs, after a brief interview, we will use brModelo 3.2 and SQL Power Architect to abstract the library's mini-world, and in the end we will create the physical model of it.

In the document Interview.docx we can see what we were able to capture during the interview with the shopkeepers.

In the document Conceitual_Loja_de_Livros_I.brM3 and Conceptual_photo_ecommerce_bookstore we have the Conceptual Model of abstraction of the miniworld of processes for the store's database. The same was done in brModelo 3.2.

In the document Logico_Loja_de_Livros_I.brM3 and Logical_photo_ecommerce_bookstore we have the Logical Model of abstraction of the miniworld of processes for the store's database. The same was also done in brModelo 3.2.

In this project, so far, I have learned about conceptual modeling from an "interview" with entrepreneurs and thus we have identified strong entities, weak entities and associative entities, relationship types, cardinality, attributes and primary and foreign keys. And then we move on to the logic model.

In the project, I did the database modeling for an e-commerce book store together with professor Daniel P. Siqueira in the courses "Database Modeling: Entities, Relationships and Attributes" and "Relational Database Modeling : Logical and Physical Modeling" at Alura!

This is my first project here! I hope I can contribute and I accept constructive criticism :)
