# Getting Started in Data Modeling // IN DEVELOPMENT
A little bit about my progress during my resumption in the world of data modeling =)

![Image of a stack of books with an apple above and beside it, in medium-sized letters, a text saying Data Modeling I, LIBRARY project, My database modeling project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102270053/179326643-0c9a82d0-0ccf-42fc-8c22-5be67989996f.png)

In this project I worked on new knowledge about the conceptual and logical modeling of a simple database for a small bookstore. 
From the survey and understanding of the library owners' needs, after a brief interview, we will use brModelo 3.2 to abstract the library's mini-world, and in a next project we will create the physical model of it. 
This is my first project here! I hope I can contribute and I accept constructive criticism :)
