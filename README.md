# Getting Started in Data Modeling // IN DEVELOPMENT
A little bit about my progress during my resumption in the world of data modeling =)

In this project I worked on new knowledge about the conceptual and logical modeling of a simple database for a small bookstore. 
From the survey and understanding of the library owners' needs, after a brief interview, we will use brModelo 3.2 to abstract the library's mini-world, and in a next project we will create the physical model of it. 

In the document Interview.docx we can see what we were able to capture during the interview with the store owners.

In the document Conceitual_Loja_de_Livros_I.brM3 we have the Conceptual Model of the mini-world abstraction of the processes for the store database. The same was done in brModelo 3.2.

In this project I learned about conceptual modeling from an "interview" with business owners and so we identified strong entities, weak entities and associative entities, relationship types, cardinality, attributes and primary and foreign keys.

In the project, I did the database modeling for a book e-commerce store together with professor Daniel P. Siqueira in the course "Database Modeling: Entities, Relationships and Attributes" on Alura!

This is my first project here! I hope I can contribute and I accept constructive criticism :)
